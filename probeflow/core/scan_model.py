"""Pure data model for loaded STM image scans.

This module deliberately contains no top-level reader, writer, validation, GUI,
or CLI imports. Keep it that way: readers, writers, validation, metadata, CLI,
and GUI can all depend on the :class:`Scan` model without creating import
cycles. The ``save_*`` convenience methods retain lazy writer imports only for
public API compatibility.

The public compatibility import remains ``from probeflow.scan import Scan``;
new internal code that only needs the dataclass should prefer importing from
``probeflow.scan_model``.

class Scan:
    """A parsed STM topography scan with all planes in display orientation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    planes
        List of 2-D float64 arrays. Canonical STM scans use SI units and the
        public order Z forward, Z backward, Current forward, Current backward.
        Selected-channel or auxiliary layouts preserve native channel order
        with units recorded in ``plane_units``. Each array is oriented for
        display: origin at the top-left and scan direction left-to-right.
    plane_names, plane_units
        Parallel lists describing each plane.
    plane_synthetic
        True when a plane was synthesised, e.g. backward mirrored from forward
        because the original file only had forward channels.
    header
        The raw vendor header dict.
    scan_range_m
        Physical ``(width_m, height_m)``.
    source_path
        Absolute path to the file we loaded from.
    source_format
        ``"sxm"`` | ``"dat"`` identifies the reader that produced this Scan.
