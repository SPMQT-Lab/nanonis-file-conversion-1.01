"""Core ProbeFlow domain objects and scan identity services.

Architectural role
------------------
This package is the intended home for the stable Session -> Probe ->
Scan/Spectrum model. Today it owns ``Scan``, scan loading, metadata, validation,
indexing, and source identity. Future ``Session``, abstract ``Probe``, and
``Spectrum`` domain models should live here.

Boundary rules
--------------
``core`` may attach a provenance graph to a probe object, but it must not define
``ImageNode``, ``MeasurementNode``, ``OperationNode``, ``ArtifactNode``, or
``ScanGraph``. Those graph dataclasses belong in ``probeflow.provenance``.
Keep parser/writer implementations in ``probeflow.io`` and array algorithms in
``probeflow.processing`` / ``probeflow.analysis``.
